; interfaces on your machine with `ip link`
; Wireless interfaces often start with `wl` and ethernet interface with `eno` or `eth`

; If no interface is specified, polybar can detect an interface of the given type.
; If multiple are found, it will prefer running interfaces and otherwise just
; use the first one found.
